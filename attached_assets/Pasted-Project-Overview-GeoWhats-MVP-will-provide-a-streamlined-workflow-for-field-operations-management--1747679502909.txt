Project Overview 
GeoWhats MVP will provide a streamlined workflow for field operations management: 
1. Supervisors can view team locations on a map 
2. Supervisors can assign tasks to teams by selecting them on the map 
3. Field teams receive task notifications and can view assigned locations 
4. Field teams can update task status and upload image evidence of completion 
5. All users access the system through responsive web interfaces

Minimum-Features: 
Feature : point → Tower & Manhole ( label for Tower is Tower No and MH is MH number ) 
Feature: Polyline → Fiber Cable ( label is Fiber length + Fiber Type) 
Feature: Polygon → Parcel ( Parcel Type could commercial or Residential  - Label Parcel No ) 
 
Boundary Status: 
Boundary Status: Unassigned , Assigned , Completed , In-Complete , Submit-Review, 
Review_Accepted, Review_Reject,Review_inprogress 
Colors will change according to status 
 
Icon Display: Please see the figure to display icon with fea_no 
 
Minimum-Attributes: 
 
ID1 ( primary key) for feature separately  ( from DB sequence ) 
Name: varchar field 
Fea_No : number assigned to each feature  ( varChar field) 
Fea_State : Plan, Under Construction, As-Built, Abandoned 
Fea_status: New , InProgress, Completed, In-Completed, Submit-Review, Active 
Maintenance : ( either Required / None) 
Maintenance Date: 
Fea_Type :  ( Tower : Mobillink / Ptcl  MH: 2-way / 4-way   FiberCable: 10F / 24F Parcel: 
Commerical/Residential 
Last Date updated: 
Remarks: 
Colors will change according to status 
 
Search by Filter: 
Fea_status: New , InProgress, Completed, In-Completed, Submit-Review, Active 
Placement workflow: 
• User Can get the current location on the map and Add, Edit and delete feature according to 
boundary he was assigned or as supervisor role no need to check for boundary status 
• User can find the location on the map and then do the same as above. 
Note: So during the selection of map location , it should remain the same place  
 
One Dashboard report: 
• Either by boundary report for the user performance for the assigned work 
• Total Project report for completion of features – work status 
Role: 
• Supervisor can do CRUD for any feature on the map 
• Field user can do CRUD for the assigned boundary ONLY 
  
Filter button on the map to filter the Data: 
 
Include → Buttons Like InProgress, …… for fea_status  ( filter the data according to status)  
Or 
ALL ( to display all the data)  
Or 
Default view  ( when initially App runs – like default view that’s fits either according to the boundary 
assigned or default view ) 
 
Advance Search by: 
*Field1: Feature  ( like MH, Fiber cable ..)  
Field2: Feature No ( fea_no) 
Field3: Feature Type 
Field4: Fea_Status 
Note: Button to execute shows the number of counts ( either on the button or ,,,, ) , once clicked 
the map should reflect the result.
